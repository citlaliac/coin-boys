## Technical Stuff

### What tools went into making this amazing app?
Typescript, React Native, Expo, CSS, and yarn to hold it all together (at least I hope--I'm still writing it but this is my goal).

### It's not in the App or Play store... How do I try it? 

Alright here we go! This is all going to be for Apple iOS simulator this time around, but expect Android in a future release. Coin boys aren't just Apple users and we want to serve as many coiners as we can.

Begin by dowloading the project locally.

Get iOS Simulator
1. Download Xcode from the app store, include the iOS package.
2. Open Xcode > Settings > Locations > Install "Command Line Tools".

Open the project
1. In the IDE of your choice, open the project (so you can play arund and change things-- this step is optional).
2. In the CLI navigate into the project.
Run it
1. In the command line run `npx expo start`.
2. Press `i` from the command line.
    /[These docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) are great for trouble shooting./
