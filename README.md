### Who can use it?
Coin boys is an app for anyone looking to live the coin boys *lifestyle*. This is not about your gender, it's about your LIFE.

## Technical Stuff

### What tools went into making this amazing app?
Typescript, React Native, Expo, CSS, Jest tests and yarn to hold it all together (at least I hope--I'm still writing it, but this is my goal).

### It's not in the App or Play store... How do I try it? 

Alright here we go! This is all going to be for Apple iOS simulator this time around, but expect Android guide in a future release. Coin boys aren't just Apple users and we want to serve as many coiners as we can.

Begin by dowloading the project locally.

Get iOS Simulator
1. Download Xcode from the app store, include the iOS package.
2. Open Xcode > Settings > Locations > Install "Command Line Tools".

Open the project
1. In the IDE of your choice, open the project (so you can play around and change things-- this step is optional).

Get Expo CLI Tools
1. Navigate into the coin-boys project in the cmd line
2. Run `npx expo` to install the CLI tools
3. Run `yarn add expo` 

Run it
1. In the command line run `npx expo start`.
2. Press `i` from the command line to start an iOS simulator, or scan the QR code to open on your device in the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
    (*[These docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) are great for trouble shooting.*)

## And how... praytell, did you come up with this amazing and complex UI?
I wire framed it of course! And got my ideas out on to paper. From there I braiinstormed what I'd like the app to do and turned those into features. For quick learning and efficiency I witled down those features to the MVP items, and have ticketed those out and been working through them.

## Show me that wire frame, please! I'm sure you are a great artist and really good at drawing quarters!!
Here's a little snapshot of one of my notebook pages:

## Wow you really captured Washington's likeness, can you show me the UI now? So I don't have to setup your silly app? 
Okay fine... here's a screen shot, just try to keep your socks from being knocked clean off.
